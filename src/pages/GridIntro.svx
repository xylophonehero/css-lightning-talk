# Grid Intro

## Why Grid?

- Flexbox in two dimensions
- Able to create complex layouts which are both responsive and fluid
- Easy to create sought after layouts from a few years ago
- 95.86% browser support

## What do you need to create a grid?

- Display property
- Template columns and/or rows and/or areas
- Gap between child
- Alignment of children "justify-content", "align-items", "place-items"...

```
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 300px;
  grid-auto-rows: 200px;
  gap: 8px;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

<SimpleGrid />

## What about fractional units

Written as ratios 1fr, 2fr. 

Much easier to grasp than flex-grow/shrink/basis.

They can also be mixed with absolute units.

```
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 100px 2fr;
  grid-auto-rows: 200px;
  gap: 8px;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

<SimpleGrid fractional />

Notice how `justify-content: center;` is now doing nothing because our fractional units gobble up all the available space.

## Child placement

By default children are placed into the next available column. If there is no space we place the child at the start of the new row.

But we can also control properties of grid children. In this example every 6th item is special

```
.special {
  grid-column-start: 2;
  grid-column-end: 4;
}
```

<SimpleGrid itemSpan />

## Ok lets get onto the good stuff!
