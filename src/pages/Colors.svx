# Color formats

## Named colors

Good for making quick examples. There some quite nice names 😹

<ColorExamples />

[Here](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html) is a list if you are intrested!

## Hex and RGB

This is what computers use and as humans we really don't understand what color something will be from three values.

Could you tell me off the top of your head what color `#8cd9d9` was 🤷‍♂️?

Even `rgb(140, 217, 217)` doesn't really tell you much.

## HSL

Much easier to understand and manipulate 😎😎

### Hue

Stands for the color shade. Usually in degrees as it comes full circle.

### Saturation

How intense the color is. 0% means greyscale 100% is fully saturated.

### Lightness

How light or dark a color is. 0% is black 100% is white.

### Back to the previous example

Could you tell me what color `hsl(180deg 50% 70%)` was 🤔?

- 180deg is around cyan area on the hue chart 🙃

- You also know the color is medium saturated so not too vibrant 👩‍🎓

- And finally 70% a little on the light side 🌤

  question="What color is hsl(180deg 50% 70%)"
  answer="Skyblue"
